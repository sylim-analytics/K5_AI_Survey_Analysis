# AI Use in K–5 Education : Survey Analysis
*This project was completed for academic purposes as part of a Master’s degree.*

## Job Relevance

- Demonstrates skills in cleaning survey data, quantitative analysis, and data visualization.
- Highlights experience with Python and Excel, commonly used in data analyst roles.
- Reflects ability to maintain data confidentiality with academic datasets.

## Overview

This Master’s project analyzes survey responses from 20 K–5 educators across eight elementary schools to explore AI usage and teacher perspectives. The 15-question survey (5 demographic, 10 AI-related) was designed and distributed via Google Forms. Data were cleaned using Python (Pandas), recoded into binary and composite variables, and visualized with Matplotlib and Seaborn to highlight key trends and challenges. Local insights were then compared with national data analyzed outside Python.

## Data Cleaning & Analysis
- Cleaned and structured the raw survey data using Python (Pandas), resolving missing values and standardizing column names and response formats.
- Encoded and aggregated survey responses by question type:
  • Binary encoding of multi-select questions into individual columns, enabling aggregation and frequency analysis.
  • Label encoding of single-select (categorical/ordinal) responses into numeric values to support visualization and statistical analysis.
- Visualized findings with Matplotlib and Seaborn, generating clear, informative plots (bar and pie charts) to highlight usage patterns, perceived benefits, concerns,

## Key Findings

- AI adoption in K–5 is early-stage, varying by teacher and subject. 
- Teachers use AI for activities, assessments, and engagement.
- Benefits include personalized learning; concerns involve overreliance and equity. 
- Training and guidance are needed for responsible AI use.
- AI should support—not replace—human-led, creative, and emotionally aware teaching.
