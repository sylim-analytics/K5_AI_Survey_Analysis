# AI Use in K–5 Education — Survey Analysis
*This project was completed for academic purposes as part of a Master’s degree.*

## Job Relevance

- Demonstrates skills in cleaning survey data, quantitative analysis, and data visualization.
- Highlights experience with Python and Excel, commonly used in data analyst roles.
- Reflects ability to maintain data confidentiality with academic datasets.

## Overview

This Master’s project analyzes survey responses from 20 K–5 educators across eight elementary schools to explore AI usage and teachers’ perspectives. The survey (15 questions: 5 demographic, 10 AI-related) was designed and distributed via Google Forms. Data was cleaned with Python (Pandas), recoded into binary/composite variables, and visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn to highlight trends and challenges. Local insights were compared with national data (analyzed outside Python).

## Data Cleaning & Analysis
- Cleaned and structured survey data with Python (Pandas), resolving missing values and standardizing formats.
- Processed data by numerically encoding Likert-scale responses and recoding multi-answer questions into binary and composite variables for quantitative analysis.
- Aggregated survey responses on various themes such as AI adoption, usage patterns, benefits, and challenges into summary variables to identify key trends.
- Visualized findings with Matplotlib and Seaborn, generating clear, informative plots to highlight usage patterns, challenges, and comparisons with national data.

## Key Findings

- AI adoption in K–5 is early-stage, varying by teacher and subject. 
- Teachers use AI for activities, assessments, and engagement.
- Benefits include personalized learning; concerns involve overreliance and equity. 
- Training and guidance are needed for responsible AI use.
- AI should support—not replace—human-led, creative, and emotionally aware teaching.
